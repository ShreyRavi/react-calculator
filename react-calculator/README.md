# react-calculator
An example of modern React code (using Hooks) for a calculator.

## [Live Demo](https://shreyravi.github.io/react-calculator/)
A live demo of the calculator can be accessed here: [Link](https://shreyravi.github.io/react-calculator/)

## Setup
1. Clone Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ShreyRavi/react-calculator.git
```
2. Navigate to Folder and Run
```
cd react-calculator
npm install
npm start
```
3. Open Browser to `http://localhost:3000/` (If Not Automatically Opened)

## React Components
- **ReactCalculator** - a React component that holds the logic for calculation and uses the below components
  - **Keypad** - a React component that displays buttons for use in input (can be used for other purposes)
  - **Display** - a React component that merely displays a state-defined string (used for calculation results)

## Built With
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)

## Future Plans
Ideally, I'd like to expand this project to build first a scientific calculator, and ultimately an entirely virtual, programmable graphing calculator.
